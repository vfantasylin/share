There are many codes about how to show protein-protein interaction and pathway enrichment analysis results simultanously, but most of them limited in one gene only can belongs to one pathway. In most case, one gene belongs to multiple pathway.
Let's see some example you may have faced!
(1) Cannot circle a gene onto multiple pathways:

(2) Cannot cluster based on the similarity of pathways:
